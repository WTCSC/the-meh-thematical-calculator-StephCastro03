# Meh-thematical Calculator  

This project is a simple Python calculator with a bit of a attitude: it’s **VERY unenthusiastic** about doing math. Instead of cheerfully solving equations, the program responds with sarcasm and complaints about your requests.  

## Features  
- Performs the four basic math operations:  
  - **Addition** (`+`)  
  - **Subtraction** (`-`)  
  - **Multiplication** (`*`)  
  - **Division** (`/`) – with built-in protection against dividing by zero  
- Written with individual functions for each operation (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)  
- Interactive input from the user  
- Snarky, tired, and sarcastic responses for every calculation  

## How to Run  
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Clone this repository or download the file.  
3. Run the program in your terminal with:  

   ```bash
   python meh_calculator.py
